# Getting Started

## Creating A New Project With The Serenity BDD Templates

The quickest way to get started with a Serenity BDD project is to use one of the starter projects. These are template projects available on Github, that contain a basic Serenity BDD skeleton project and a single test implementation. These template projects are kept up-to-date with the most recent stable version of Serenity BDD.

The main available starter projects are the following:

| Template | Description | Get Started |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------|
| [Serenity BDD with JUnit](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-junit-starter) | A simple project structure using Serenity BDD, JUnit 5 and an Action Classes/Page Objects architecture. | **[Use This Template](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-junit-starter/generate)** |
| [Serenity BDD with JUnit and Screenplay](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-junit-screenplay-starter) | A project built around the Screenplay Pattern using Serenity BDD, JUnit 5 and Serenity Screenplay |  **[Use This Template](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-junit-screenplay-starter/generate)** |
| [Serenity BDD with Cucumber and Screenplay](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-cucumber-starter) | A BDD-style test suite using Cucumber and Serenity Screenplay | **[Use This Template](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-cucumber-starter/generate)** |

To create a new project, go to the project template you want to use, and click on the "Use this template" button. This will allow you to create a new project in your own Github repository.

If you are working on an internal project, you can also download the template project by clicking on the "Code" button.
